Case is not that premium but overall these tws are good to invest . anc and app support is missing in these so called premium buds from boat . balance mode is also below average but bass mode / signature mode is very good specially for bass lovers . battery is awesome. Overall good deal .
"As of now, the calling is awesome. Music is also good . The main feature battery backup needs to be tested for a few weeks.
Hope boat ⛵ don't disappoint us."
All rounder earpbuds one of the best earbud i have used

"Writting this review after 6 days of usage.
In this TWS you'll get everything you want but obviously except ANC.
calling is superb even during bike ride.
I get to know about bass only in this TWS 😅.
Battery is superb and touch control are super sensitive.
In ear detection is pretty good. Best main feature of these TWS is that they shows battery percentage in notification centre.
The only cons of these TWS is sometimes they start ear paining not everytime but sometimes."
"Here the review of product after over a month of usage.
Sound quality is really good, there are certain modes like signature sound, balance mode and beast mode. You can differentiate between signature sound and balance mode as certain changes are noticable but I couldn't find any significant difference in beast mode.
Next about it's design, it's very well but buds tend to fall off after some time, definitely not recommended to use in gym, jogging or while on bike.
I'm honestly disappointed w...

Will use for more and shall the feed back."
"It is good for indoor purposes, like if you are using it in your house or some closed place.
But if you are planning to buy these for running then no buy something else.
While running it abruptly disconnect or stop working.
Otherwise for indoor purposes and all the other features are really nice."

discomfort

times to fix it

"It's a good TWS with extremely great battery backup. ANC is okay. 255 rockerz ANC has better ANC. Sound is okay. Expecting the inclusion of spatial sound through some updates. Manual power on-off is missing. It's a major drawback. Once the battery of the case is over, the buds will not be turned on even though those have full charge. You need to connect the case with the charger, and then only you will be able to connect the buds."
Sound quality super and 2 modes of sound soo expensive
"Sound quality is good, the background sound detailing is awesome
Fit is good
Bass is good
Value for money"

"Super sound quality, worth every penny"
Excellent product.really enjoying sound quality and bass.
"The product is good as expected, battery backup is owsm, build quality is good but the case is a bit slippery, there are chances of dropping it from the hand. Sound quality is decent, but in order to experience the best of the bass you need to manually adjust the equalizer settings. The call quality is good, haven't tried the ANC mode yet. Overall a good package at this price."

"Review after 6-7 days of usage.The pros:The sound quality is fantastic!!It comes with 4 buds total, 2 small sized, 2 larger sized. And 2 medium sized fitted with the earbuds. I changed my buds to the smaller size and they fit perfect!!The gaming usage is also great!!It connects very fast after the case opens.There are plenty features to use directly through the earbuds.Charging is very fast! 5 min charge gives plenty of playtime!!Cons:The case is made of plastic and is vulnerable to light scratches. But as long as you don't roughly throw it around or rub it against rough surfaces, it is going to be in perfect condition. The earbuds are also slightly plastic but once again , no rough usage and it's gonna be alright.My favourite part of them is the bass!! The bass + noise cancelling is just perfect and sweet!!!!!"
"Let me start with the elephant in the room claim - 24 hours battery back up from buds alone. I received this TWS around 6:45 in the evening, took about a couple  minutes to check the box contents and make sure the TWS was in perfect condition. Paired them with my phone only to find out the earbuds had 100% charge, so I started using them. I initiated my ""testing"" at 7 p.m. with The Jurassic Park (1993) at about 80% volume. 2 hours later, the buds had ~93% charge left. I said, ""Challenge accepted!"", and then watched the sequel, The Lost World (1997). Another 2 hours and some odd minutes later, the time was 11:10 p.m., the left bud showed 86% battery and the right was at 85%. At this point, I could see myself losing the battle, but I didn't wanna give up. I thought to myself, ""Maybe if I tried harder, I'd win."" But time, as always, wasn't on my side. It was 11:20 p.m., the silence of the night could be heard loudly and the fatigue of the day was catching up to me, when suddenly, an idea popped into my head. I rushed over to YouTube, searched for a 10 hour heavy metal music video, hit the play button, increased the earbuds volume to 100%, and then put both my phone and the buds on the bedside table grinning to myself thinking, ""Yeah, survive that."", and called it a night. The morning came and as my vision cleared up to show 7:20 a.m. on the clock, I reached out to my phone, assuredly and confidently convinced, I had won the war.I didn't. The right bud was at 41% and the left at 45%. At this juncture, I gladly accepted my defeat and decided to write this story, a story of a brave TWS, a story that will never be in any history books, a story where the eternal TWS won against its sadistic owner.As for the rest, I will keep it brief;In-ear Detection: Works very well, no complaints.Sound Quality: Signature mode is too bass-y, not for me, for sure. Balance mode does the job and it does it well.Call quality: THE BEST. Tested against Boat Rockers 255 Neo, Boult Audio X50, Dizo GoPods Neo, Realme T100.Build Quality: Buds good. Case lid, when closed, has a slight wobble to it. Everything else is upto the mark.One final remark would be in-ear fitting, and thus, noise isolation. I find these buds to provide noise isolation as good as Dizo Gopods Neo with its 25Db ANC mode on. It almost feels like they were custom made for my ears. But do keep in mind that this can and will differ from person to person.Thank you for your time and I hope I didn't waste it."
Very good product good bass and provides comfort to the listner. Good colour. Qualities according to the value.good performance and long battery life and fast charging.
The product is very good... There is no issue in the product i am using it for like 2 months and I am not facing any issues the in ear detection works well it would give you trouble if the ear puff size is not correct try to use the puffs of you ear size the charging is good sound quality is also not bad . It's fit for ear and don't give any pain but it is a bit big but it's the best product and value for money...... satisfied 😃
I have oppo enco buds 2 sound quality is ultimate but battery backup is very poor using from 7-8 months so i decided to buy new tws then i brought boat nirvana ion and experienced that sound quality is top class i didn't feel much difference between oppo enco and nirvana only i noticed that bass is little higher in oppo enco in normal mode but in boat signature mode bass is solid so overall i m happy with this product clearity of vocals is really good also i m surprised when i install boat hearable app it supports custom Equalizer and its working awesome value for money battery backup is insane go for it without thought its best in segment with features also ₹1500 price 🔥🔥
"This is really an awesome budget TWS from boat.Here are my points-•Good quality case•Really good battery life•Two eq modes, which are both good. Balanced mode has all the bass, treble, highs balanced while the signature mode has a thumpy bass effect.•The buds has app compatibility and has quite customisations. We can turn off the in-ear detection on or off.•Touch controls are really impressive and responsive.Overall this is a good package @₹1599. Better than other cheap alternatives."
Performance and base is really good and connectivity is next level.Touch  control and overall appearance is really good.mat finish design i loved it
Reviewing after almost 6 months and very glad to use it. Although my usage is very small like max 40 minutes per day but it's backup is real good. With this minimal usage the charge retains for almost 2.5 weeks. It's finish is also good which gives it a premium feel

I have been using these earbuds for several weeks now, and I haven't had to charge them once! It's incredibly convenient not having to worry about battery life.Connectivity & Controls (4.5/5):Pairing the earbuds with my devices was quick and hassle-free. They connect automatically once removed from the case. The touch controls are responsive and easy to use, allowing me to play/pause music, skip tracks, and answer calls effortlessly.Case & Portability (4/5):The charging case is compact and pocket-friendly, making it easy to carry around.

Best TWS in the range of 2000 rupees everything is perfect battery life is just amazing I am using this all day but I don't even need to charge it for many days and there is no  distortion in the sound when volume is at 100%
Best sound and best earbuds value for money 😇
"I used so many under the price range but this beats it all. I got it for 1599 and it's impressive how you get so much battery life it definitely delivers and is durable, I've dropped it like 4-5 times and also the buds it's all good what's promised and can be tuned and customized from the dedicated app itself. The signature sound is just too good considering the price range"
Speaker quality is good and base is good
"If you are looking for a TWS under 1500 just go for it it's excellent product. In all terms like the fit, calling, listening to music everything is excellent ❤️"

"This is just the best-ever TWS made in the world—hats off. The battery life is like a lifetime. I listen to music and audiobooks at 50-60% volume and the battery is still 90-100% even after 5-10 hours. Just wow. It's a great product with great sound, bass, and app support. 10/10. That's it."
"I recently purchased the Navana Airdopes and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed! The sound quality is fantastic, with crisp highs and deep bass that really enhance my music listening experience. The Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, allowing me to easily pair them with my devices.One of the things I love most about these Airdopes is how comfortable they are to wear. The ergonomic design fits snugly in my ears, and I can wear them for hours without any discomfort. Plus, they stay in place even during vigorous workouts, which is a huge plus for me.The battery life is also impressive, providing several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case is compact and convenient, making it easy to keep my Airdopes powered up on the go.Overall, I highly recommend the Navana Airdopes to anyone in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds. Great sound quality, comfortable fit, and long battery life make them a fantastic value for the price. 5 stars from me"

Sounds are good
"I am writing this review here after using it for 3 weeks!Great Battery Backup ✔️I've used it for up to 5 days without charging the case. The earbuds' battery will last up to 7 hours even in full volume, which is what impressed me most about this product.boAt Signature Sound ✔️The drivers of these earbuds deliver a very rich crystal bionic audio output, and it is recommended to use Signature Sound as the default setting for spatial sound effects.Product Quality ✔️It is made from standard high-grade plastic, making it resilient to a few drops without causing significant damage. With IPX4 sweat resistance, it's suitable for gym trainers and travelers. However, it's important not to assume it is waterproof.Comfort - The only thing that disappointed me is that these earbuds feel a bit heavy when placed in the ear, possibly due to their design. You have to position them correctly in each ear, or you will experience a little discomfort after using them for long periods.Overall, it's a nice product, you won't regret spending your money on this purchase, I bet. Worth buying!"

For battery it is king..no matter you go journey for week it works .Thanks Aman gupta to your company .It will be the great milestone in this segment according price ..There is smth missing from one plus bud sound in this price segment but overall good and excellent battery 👌"
"As a previous user of Apple Airpods Gen 2, I was doubtful whether to purchase this or not. In sale, got this product for Rs.1599. The build quality, appearance, sound quality and feel is really premium. The only con I think is when the music has a lot of instruments, it tends to get cloudy. Coming from apple to Boat, its the only difference I notice. Other people may not even notice that, so feel free and just go for it."
Amazing product for music lovers.Highly worth it for this rate.Charge longevity is awesome.Crystal clear sound quality.Matte finished . But the ear buds will not suit for all.Its a luck.For me it was perfect.Good noise cancellation.

These wireless earbuds deliver exceptional sound quality, with crisp highs and deep bass, making every listening experience truly immersive. The sleek design and comfortable fit ensure they stay securely in place, even during intense workouts or daily commutes.What truly sets the Nirvana Ion Airdopes apart is their impressive battery life. With long-lasting playback time and a quick charging feature, I never have to worry about running out of juice when I'm on the go. The touch controls are intuitive and easy to use, allowing me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with just a tap.Furthermore, the Bluetooth connectivity is seamless, providing a stable connection without any interruptions. Whether I'm pairing them with my smartphone, tablet, or laptop, the Airdopes deliver consistent performance every time.Overall, I highly recommend the Nirvana Ion Airdopes to anyone in search of high-quality wireless earbuds. They offer an unbeatable combination of sound quality, comfort, and convenience, making them a must-have accessory for music lovers and tech enthusiasts alike."

App support is ok ok you don't use it frequentlyOnly problem is it's fitting it's earcups are so tight that it creates so much of vaccum inside your ear that after some time you need to remove it to pass some air to your ears. Some time means 30min to 1hr.Although it's buds size is big it feels sometimes that it may fall from your earAnd if you are music love like me which always plays music on full volume you are definitely going to get migraine after hearing continuous song for half and hour to 1hr.One day I saw a full movie of 3h in its full volume continuous, it's was a mind blowing experience but when I removed earphone it's like I'm not able to listen my surround's sound for 5 to 10 minIt's all compared to my neckband realme buds wireless 2s"
Just received the item... I'm totally impressed by everything.. From. App to sound. Will update the review after few months of use🦦
"OMG what a great product,I'm very very much satisfied with this product at this price range is uncomparable.... Wow 😘✨👏🏼👏🏼"
This Bluetooth boAt Nirvana Ion TWS Earbuds is very amazing buds. The sound quality good. This product is a value for money.
Easy to ear us nice touch fit to ear fast charging nice performance
The product was very good sound quality was excellent price was reasonable thank you🙏🏼
This is one of the best earbuds I have ever used. The performance is par excellence and the beast mode is an added bonus.  Good quality for the optimum price.
Yeah you read it right it is the best but fitting doesn't goes with me personally and actually with some of my friends using this earphones also...so ya it can be an issue if you are using it for very long time as it hurts in ears and really hampers the experience... You must be thinking why is it best then?? So the answer is that what I have written above is the only and only problem I could find in 6 months of usage...it is what makes it best

"The music and mic quality is the best. When I used signature sound, I emmersed in the sea of Music! It's tneble is also quite good in Signature mode. The beast mode and in-ear detection is also working well with low latency! I am satisfied."
I'M GONNA SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST PURCHASE IN TWS I'VE DONE EVER. THE SOUND QUALITY WAS JUST EXTRA ORDINARY IN THIS PRICE RANGE. THE BUILD QUALITY IS VERY GOOD IN THIS PRICE POINT. THE BATTERY LIFE IS 120HRS WHEN YOU USING THIS BUDS ON 60% VOLUME ON 100% IT WILL BE FOR 80 HRS AGAIN FOR THIS PRICE RANGE IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. THE PERFORMANCE IN GAMING WAS TOO GOOD. IT GIVES 60MS LATENCY WHILE GAMING. SO OVERALL IT'S WORTH TO PURCHASE AND VALUE FOR MONEY.
I am quite impressed with this product and its quality. It can be even controlled by he app  like its touch responses and of course its bass is its highlighting point. So for this price its a worthful buy for me.
"Nirvana looks premium and good quality make, music & beats are nice. Just got delivered today so can't say about battery life yet. Rest i will update the review later after a week of usage. Thank you"
"Very good tws under 2000/-. The sound quality was perfect. Value for money..charging and battery backup are good. Apperance was cute, better durability and better performance. Budget friendly product.. Overall, the boat Nirvana Ion earbuds are an excellent choice for those seeking quality sound and reliable battery life at an affordable price point. While they may not compete with the premium tier of earbuds, they certainly stand out in the budget category."
Nice quality sound
Received the product yesterday. The sound mids and base is good. The earbuds reduce the external noise by upto 80% when listening to songs. Calling in home environment is good. Mic is good.

Pros1. Sound quality - music lovers can go boat with out any doubt.2. Battery - If you use it for long hours and definitely better option along with good sound quality.3. Design - Looks good4. Build quality - I have dropped 3-4 time with in 4days and I couldn't notice any damage.5. Controls - Sensors working accurately.Cons.1. Buds - May be it depends on person. It's completely covering my ear (ear canal) and getting irritation if I use it for long.Rest all good...
I bought them in Apr 2024 for around 1.6k. These are some of the best TWS in the price range. The battery is great. The sound stage is good for the price range too. It is comfortable for long usage.
